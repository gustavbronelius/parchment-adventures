Parchment Adventures is a extremely versatile text-based adventure based on generative AI.

# Introduction
Parchment Adventures is inspired by text-based adventure games from the 80s and 90s. The twist is that this game uses modern day generative AI, in this case OpenAI, to create the story and process user commands. This leads to an extremely versatile game where you can basically do anything you want in whatever setting you'd like.

I partially created this game to give my students a more interactive way to practice reading which is why it has features like dictionaries and word lists.

# Getting Started
## How to install and run
I understand that for some people this experience of installing a game might feel a bit strange and scary. If you get stuck or have some questions, join me on [Discord](https://discord.gg/pWU7NNzq) and I can help you.

### 1. Download the game
Download the game at https://github.com/gustavbronelius/parchment-adventures/archive/refs/heads/main.zip.

### 2. Extract the game
After downloading the game, navigate to the folder where it is downloaded. On a newer version of Windows, you should be able to right-click the folder and press "Extract". If that doesn't work, you can download 7zip or Winrar.

### 3. Python
You need to install Python on your computer to run the game. You can download Python on https://www.python.org/downloads/.

### 4. Installing and running
After installing Python, you need to navigate to the extracted folder, parchment-adventures-main. In that folder, you need to run these two files:

1. Install dependencies (Windows)
2. start (Windows)

### 5. OpenAI API Key
The first time you run the game, you will be asked to enter your OpenAI API key (check the black and white console window). 

![Enter your API key:](assets/images/api_key.png)

The API key is used to connect your game to the generative AI. Processing commands with the AI costs about 0.001 to 0.01 USD per command (it depends a bit on how long your game has been running).

You can order a API key at https://platform.openai.com/api-keys. You also need to make sure you have some dollar available on the account the API key is connected to. 5 USD will be more than enough.

- You can share your API key with friends or family members who would like to play the game. Just make sure that you don't share it online with strangers (they can use your API key to run commands which might quickly use those 5 USD on your account). In case the API key goes escapes into the wild, you can remove it on the openai website.

- This key is vital to running the game as without it, no commands can be processed.

- If you are worried about how much the game is costing, you can check usage at this website https://platform.openai.com/usage. Fun fact, during the month long development of this game, I have used about 6 USD (Dec 23).

## Usage
### How to play
Start the game with the file "start (Windows)"

![Extracted folder](assets/images/folder.png)

The game is played using the main console window. Write a command and press enter to send it to the narrator. The narrator will continue the story and the game will update your quests, items, etc.

### How to configure
The context of the game is based on a couple of files in the config folder.

- summary.txt
- game_state.txt

#### Summary
The summary states the summary of the history up to the start of the gamne. You can use the summary to easily change the setting of the game. Cowboys in space? Deep ones hiding in Innsmouth? Knights of Ni defending castles?

#### Game state
The game state states the items and quests you start with. Feel free to change this to whatever you'd like. 

### Advanced configurations
- narrator_task_description.txt
- game_state_manager_task_description.txt
- history_manager_task_description.txt

#### Narrator
#### Game State Manager
#### History Manager
